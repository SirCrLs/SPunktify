2. The music its located on an external server on supabase.com, before this change it was 100% local so you dont have to do anything on this step

3.  run generate script that is located in /data/generate.js
    Terminal:
        SPunktify> cd data
        SPunktify/data> node generate.js
        [LOG] Listo! JSONs generados ✔   (JSONs generated)
    

4.  Start Expo GO
    Terminal:
            SPunktify> npx expo start

For now, I think its everything you need to do for you to run SPunktify locally. Thanks.
